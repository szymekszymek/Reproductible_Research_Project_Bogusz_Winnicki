It provides a system for classifying and aggregating occupational information obtained by means of population censuses and other statistical surveys, as well as from administrative records. The framework necessary for designing and constructing ISCO-88 has been based on two main concepts: the concept of the kind of work per-formed or job, and the concept of skill. Job - defined as a set of tasks and duties executed, or meant to be executed, by one person - is the statistical unit classified by ISCO-88. A set of jobs whose main tasks and duties are characterised by a high degree of similarity constitutes an occupation. Persons are classified by occupation through their relationship to a past, present or future job. Skill - defined as the ability to carry out the tasks and duties of a given job - has, for the purposes of ISCO-88 the two following dimensions: (a) Skill level - which is a function of the complexity and range of the tasks and duties involved; and (b) Skill specialisation - defined by the field of knowledge required, the tools and machinery used, the materials worked on or with, as well as the kinds of goods and services produced.","1820511","1","20",,"TOTAL",,"Total","1820512","1","30",,"ISCO1-5",,"Non manual workers","This aggregate includes the ISCO positions ISCO1, ISCO2, ISCO3, ISCO4
